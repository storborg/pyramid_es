=================================

Scott Torborg - `Cart Logic <http://www.cartlogic.com>`_

``pyramid_es`` is a pattern and set of utilities for integrating the
`elasticsearch <http://www.elasticsearch.org>`_ search engine with a `Pyramid
<http://www.pylonsproject.org>`_ web app. It is intended to make it easy to
index a set of persisted objects and search those documents inside Pyramid
views.
